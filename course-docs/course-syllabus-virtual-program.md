### Point Values for Course Assignments

Points for assignments will vary based on the type of assignment and the length of the assignment. Students will be given a 1 week grace period after the due date to turn in an assignment if its late. After the 1 week, that assignment will not be excepted for credit. All late assignments that are turned in within the grace period will have points deducted for being late.

***Example***
- If an assignment is worth 10 points, and the student turns in the assignment on time, they could earn from 0-10 points
- If the assignment is turned in after the due date, but within the 1 week grace period, they could earn 0-7 points
- If the assignment is turned in after the 1 week grace period, the assignment will be given a score of 0
