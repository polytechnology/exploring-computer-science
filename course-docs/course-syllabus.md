### Point Values for Course Assignments/Class Participation

Most assignments, if not all of them can be completed in the classroom. Therefore, I **will not** accept any late assignments without permission and a verified reason from the student’s parents as to why the assignment is late.

Your grade is weighted in this course. 50% of a students grade comes from class participation and 50% comes from course projects.

#### Class Participation

Each day a student can earn up to 3 points. If the student is absent, these points can't be made up unless a verified absent note is given. Students that are on their phone, or have their phone out during class and it was not approved will lose all points for the day. Each time a student is off task for any given reason, they will lose 1 point for each time up to 3 times a period.

#### Project time length 

Projects will be both individual and group work. Projects can be completed in a class period or last up to several weeks.

The point value veries based on the proejct.

#### Test, Quizzes, and Finals

All, test, quizzes, and finals will be taken on a computer in the classroom. They will include but are not limited to true and false, matching, and multiple choice or short essay questions.
