# Unit 1 - Digital Literacy
Digital literacy covers basic computing principles and foundational knowledge of computer programming.

## Topics

### Creating a Strong Foundation
Computer Science is a rewarding yet challenging field to get into. In order for you to be successful, you need to have a strong foundation in how you learn through critical thinking, problem solving and working as a team.

### Computer Basics
We're going to challenge what it means to be digitally literate by pulling back the curtain of how computers work. By the end of this lesson you should have a foundational understanding of computers and how we communicate with them.

### How the Internet Works
Knowing how the technology you use everyday works will make you a more thoughtful and powerful user of technology. In this course we'll explore how the Internet works, by investigating hardware like routers, switches, and servers and the TCP/IP protocols that define how information moves from computer to computer.

### How the Web Works
In order to surf the world wide web, you need an application called a web browser. You're probably familiar with this, you might even be learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to program for the web, but have you ever looked into how it works? In this course, we'll dissect each aspect of how the web works. You'll learn about URLs, domain names, IP addresses, the domain name system, and the HTTP protocol, to be fully prepared for web development or just a more knowledgeable web user.
