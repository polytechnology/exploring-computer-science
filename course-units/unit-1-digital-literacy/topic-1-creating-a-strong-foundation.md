#### Build a Learning Mindset

No one's born "smart" or "stupid." Intelligence is something we can always increase by working our brains like muscles to grow neurons, and develop deeper and stronger neural connections. A "Growth Mindset" can literally help you learn better, while a "Fixed Mindset" can keep you from pushing yourself to learn and grow.

**Statements:**

“I’m no good at this”, rather say “How can I improve”

“I give up”, say “Let me try a different way”

“I failed” say “Mistakes are part of learning”

“This is too hard” say “Learning just takes time”

Think about the term muscle memory. You build muscle by repetition.

#### Focus Your Mind, Improve Your Learning

Learn how your brain uses "focused" and "diffused" modes of thought to learn and make new neural connections. Use strategies to reduce distractions, improve focus, and learn better.

##### Tips to Engage Your Mind and Stay Focused

**Prepare your body**

Exercise: exercise pumps oxygen to our brain, and can even generate new neurons
Food: healthy fats like eggs, nuts and avocado energizes and increases production of neurotransmitters in your brain
Caffeine: use it carefully. Exercise can be a better way to wake up in the morning.

**Prepare your Mind**

Mix focused and diffused modes. Your brain wants roughly an hour of focus and 15 minutes of diffused activity
Try the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to help you create a pattern of focus and break times
Decide exactly what you want to focus on, before diving into focus mode

**Prepare your space**

Turn off distractions: no cellphone, close unneeded applications and notifications on your computer. find a quiet space to work (if possible)
Wear headphones: noises can be distracting. Try listening to nature sounds, white noise, or music without lyrics.
