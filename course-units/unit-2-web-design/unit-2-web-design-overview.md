## Topics

#### Introduction to HTML and CSS
Get started creating web pages with HTML and CSS, the basic building blocks of web development. HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a standard set of tags you will use to tell the web browser how the content of your web pages and applications are structured. Use CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, to select HTML tags and tell the browser what your content should look like. Whether you are coding for fun or planning to start a career in web development, learning HTML and CSS is a great place to start.

#### HTML Basics
Learn HTML (HyperText Markup Language), the language common to every website. HTML describes the basic structure and content of a web page. If you want to build a website or web application, you'll need to know HTML.

#### Web Accessibility
You’ll learn about the standards in place to guide developers in creating a web that is accessible to all users as well as techniques to help bring your projects up to those standards. 


#### Web Design Process
Going from a blank screen to a finished website can be daunting. In this course, you'll learn about the major steps involved in designing websites. We'll learn how to gather information, explore potential concepts, and iterate on a design. By the end, you'll have the foundation you need to continue your design journey.

#### CSS Basics
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language that describes the presentation of web pages. Whereas HTML is what forms the structure of a web page, CSS is what we use to style the HTML with colors, backgrounds, font sizes, layout, and more. As you'll soon learn, CSS is one of the core technologies for designing and building websites.

Besides the common ways to select elements with type, ID and class selectors, we're able to target elements based on their attributes, position in the HTML document, even their relation to other elements. By the end of this course, you'll have gained a better understanding of the power and flexibility behind CSS selectors. You'll have a new set of valuable tools in your CSS toolkit to use on your next project.
