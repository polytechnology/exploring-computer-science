# Unit 3 - Programming

JavaScript powers the interactivity and the user experience on every major website. From user interfaces that provide richer desktop-like experiences to real-time data and messaging applications, you'll find JavaScript in the browser, on your phone and on the server. In this track we'll introduce you to the JavaScript language, jQuery, the popular JavaScript framework and the ins-and-outs of adding interactivity in the browser. You'll also learn the fundamentals of programming by learning this fun and easy-to-get-started with language.

## Topics

#### Data Types and Variables
JavaScript variables and data types are the foundation for creating programs that can store and retrieve information.

#### Functions
Functions are at the heart of JavaScript. They let you create code you can reuse, and make performing the same steps over and over again simple, and your programs shorter.

#### Arrays and Loops
Arrays provide a way of storing more than one value in a single place. And loops let you repeat the same set of actions a certain number of times, and are frequently used to perform tasks on items in an array. 

#### Objects and Conditionalss
JavaScript objects provide a way to store and access data as key-value pairs. And conditional statements let you create intelligent programs that can react to different conditions.
