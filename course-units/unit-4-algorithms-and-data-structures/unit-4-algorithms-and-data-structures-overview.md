# Unit 4 - Algorithms and Data Structures

In this unit, you'll learn about two of the fundamental topics in computer science - algorithms and data structures. With increasing frequency algorithms are starting to shape our lives in many ways - from the products recommended to us, the friends we interact with on social media and even in important social issues like policing, privacy and healthcare. By the end of this track you will understand what algorithms and data structures are, how they are measured and evaluated and how they are used to solve common, complex problems.

## Topics

#### Introduction to Alogorithms
Algorithms are a fundamental topic in computer science, power many of the largest companies today and are used in making many decisions that affect our day to day lives - in obvious places like Google's PageRank algorithm to more obscure use cases like national security and local policing. In this introductory course, we're going to take our first steps towards understanding the world of algorithms and data structures. Before we can study individual algorithms we're going to spend time learning how to evaluate algorithms, how to make comparisons and how to develop algorithmic thinking.

#### Introductions to Data Structures
In computer science a data structure is a construct that allows us to organize and store data in our programs. In this course we're going to learn about two introductory data structures - arrays and linked lists! We'll look at common operations and how the runtimes of these operations affect our everyday code. For the rest of the course we're going to bring our knowledge of algorithms and data structures together to solve the problem of sorting data using the merge sort algorithm.

#### Alogorithms: Sorting and Searching
We will look at algorithms in two categories: sorting and searching. We'll implement well-known sorting algorithms like selection sort, quicksort, and merge sort. You'll also learn basic search algorithms like sequential search and binary search.
